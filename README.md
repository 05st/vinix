#### Goals

- Keep it simple and easy to understand.
- Write it in V as much as possible.
- Target modern 64-bit architectures and CPU features.

#### Why?

- Explore V capabilities in bare metal programming.
- Break the compiler as much as possible.
- Build a minimal and useful platform for software [especially written in V :^)], allowing for better control, isolation, and smaller attack surface in VMs.
- Having fun.
